<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kevin</h1>

<p>About Me: From IT Vet to Code Newbie (and loving it!) <br>
  
Hey there! I'm Kevin, and I'm currently diving headfirst into the world of software engineering at TripleTen. For over a decade, I've been knee-deep in IT, helping folks at insurance companies, hospitals, and other tech places keep their systems humming as an executive desktop support technician. I even managed to snag an AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification along the way!

Truth be told, I've always loved figuring out how things work and, even more, fixing them when they break. That passion for problem-solving is what got me into IT, and it's what's driving me now to become a software engineer. I'm excited to use those same skills to tackle bigger, more complex challenges â€“ the kind that code can solve. So, while I might be a "newbie" to writing full-blown applications, I'm bringing a ton of real-world IT experience and a serious love for getting things done. Let's build some cool stuff!</p>

**Currently:** 
Leveling up my coding skills at TripleTen to become a software engineer! ðŸš€

**Learning:** ðŸŒ± 
Everything from Figma, CSS, HTML to React, Node JS and building full-stack applications with databases.

**Status:** 
No big personal projects *yet*, but my bootcamp assignments are proof of concept that I can learn fast and build things! ðŸ˜‰
